Usage:

run from the command prompt:  ogp.rb

shotgun -p4567 ogp.rb

To test https, I suggest setting up an https-capable web forwarding server/daemon (I use NGINX)
and have it point to http://localhost:4567/, ogp is then served from https://localhost/*

Getting started:

*1) point your web browser to http://localhost:4567/initialize/

this will set up the databases appropriately.

2) use test genbank files that are in the ./DNAutics/testfile/ directory.

*3) upload them using the applet at http://localhost:4567/upload/

*currently broken. (19 Feb 2012)


Note:  raphael.js is not the default raphael, it has been changed to allow for css to be applied to elements.
