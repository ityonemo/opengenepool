OpenGenePool README

Requires:

Ruby
MySql

Following Rubygems:

sinatra
haml
mysql

Recommended for development:

shotgun

Usage:

run from the command prompt:  ogp.rb

With shotgun:

shotgun -p4567 ogp.rb

This works quite well in linux.  If you are using macOS, it should work similarly.  If you use
windows, god help you.

To test https, I suggest setting up an https-capable web forwarding server/daemon (I use NGINX)
and have it point to http://localhost:4567/, ogp is then served from https://localhost/

Getting started:

1) point your web browser to http://localhost:4567/initialize/

this will allow you to initialize the databases and set up a superuser account

2) login using the superuser

3) find test genbank files that are in the ./testfile/ directory.

4) upload them using the applet at http://localhost:4567/upload/
