OpenGenePool README

Requires:

Ruby
MySql

Following Rubygems:

sinatra
haml
mysql

Recommended for development:

shotgun

Usage:

run from the command prompt:  ogp.rb

With shotgun:

shotgun -p4567 ogp.rb

To test https, I suggest setting up an https-capable web forwarding server/daemon (I use NGINX)
and have it point to http://localhost:4567/, ogp is then served from https://localhost/

Getting started:

1) point your web browser to http://localhost:4567/initialize/

this will allow you to initialize the databases and set up a superuser account

2) login using the superuser

3) find test genbank files that are in the ./testfile/ directory.

4) upload them using the applet at http://localhost:4567/upload/


VERSION 0.1

current, prioritized limitations:  Essentially single-user.  (mostly) Read-only.

clone button.
workspace/filesystem manipulation.
user-modified graphics settings.
